Hello! I'm Antony. I'm in Grade 12. I like being creative.

I love watching hockey. My favourite team is the Ottawa Senators. GO SENS GO!

I also like YouTube. My favourite channel is TheStraightPipes, a cool Canadian car reviewing channel.

My dream cars are the Honda Civic Si Coupe, Honda Civic Type R, and Acura NSX.
